Why is it I think Yameii Online is wonderful? 

Sounds amazing. I love the voice somehow. The sound is so unpredictable but consistent. She cuts in over herself. What is it about technomusic. It's also the lyrics? 
"Let me get one chance" 
"They dont understand"
"Dont save me"
"with my friends, go crazy"
"ok ok ok ok"
"they want to see the life I live"
"hate if you're mad" 
"and away we go"
"just so you know I'm not alone no more"
"Hate if youre mad, came through the backdoor"
"Yameii not a toy don't play me" 
"Back at it again" 
"dont let me go I'll get on my phone more" 

I don't understand the meaning of the lyrics. I don't even understand what shes saying some of the time. Yameii is sassy and care-free and has energy and in your face. She's got friends. She dances and sings and the music isn't serious. It's exciting and full of energy. But she's cutesy too. She's vulnerable. And the samples go hard. 

Now, honestly I haven't thought this through. But here's my philosophy. I can publish stupid unrefined material; One, by writing about it I illuminate my good and bad theories/connections/ideas. You might say "oh no how could he think that"? Is it better to process bad thoughts or leave them to fester? Everyone starts somewhere and by writing through the thoughts, I'll make a lot more progress than if I were afraid of putting my ideas out there. Plus, I want your perspectives! Sharpens the discussions. 
Historically, writing was restricted at least partially by publishing limitations; writing had to be of a certain quality before it could be reproduced and distributed to be consumed. Why bother with that; this blog isnt about vetted information. It's about generating new ideas. Trying things out. Half-baked ideas. Formalizing is the boring part most times anyway. That doesn't mean I don't want to make sure my ideas aren't coherent and consistent with reality/non-logical. 
Maybe I can make a second section for "refined, polished works" as oppsoed to works in progress. 

I think the haters see a couple things. I think outsiders think there's something sinister about a 20 something year old guy making music under the alias a of a digital avatar of a teen girl and me another 20 something guy enjoying it. I think it's immediately associated with asian high-school girl oriented pervy men; but it's cool to develop a fictional character whose the artist, someone who has their own synthetic voice. That has never before been possible. 

Ditzy loopy brave and friend-oriented is my paraphrasing of what I assume to be the creator's description on spotify.
