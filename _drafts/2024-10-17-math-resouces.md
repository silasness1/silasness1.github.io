If someone wants a coding project, I would recommend algorithmically scouring youtube for more content. But here's my list based on some manual efforts: 
A full list of statistical lectures on youtube 
Here are my top 5 based on what looks interesting and of good rigorous quality, in no particular order.
  
1) Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking
Luckily, there's a textbook by the same name! 
And course notes   

2) Jingyi Li's Hierarchical Linear models
McCullagh & Nelder (1989), Generalized Linear Models, Chapman & Hall 
Gelman & Hill (2007), Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models 
Gelman et al (2014), Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd Edition), Chapman & Hall
There are also course notes

3) Chieh Wu's Mathematics of Data Models
Not sure about an existing textbook nor associated problems, but looks like great quality lecture.

4) Samuel Wong's Applied Linear Models
Casella and berger ST331 was in the background
Optional reference book: Introduction to Regression Modeling by Bovas Abrahamand Johannes Ledolter, 2006.

5) Math with Richard's Linear Algebra
Book recommendations: ''Elementary Linear Algebra' by Andrilli and Hecker
Linear Algebra - From the Beginning' - Carlen and Carvalho
Linear Algebra' - Lay

As a general remark, PDFs of textbooks can be found online.
