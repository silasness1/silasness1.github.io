### Some "dreams" 

* Design own origami model
* convince people to take action wrt climate change
* Be able to come up with my own arrangement for cool songs with classical finger guitar or piano or violin
* Be able to speak spanish, german and japanese
* Become some kind of interviewer whose job it is to dig into peoples lives & just listen 
write all my opinions on the world and leave it for someone else to read/get a shortcut on "the truth" whatever that is 
* Why do I want to be able to draw? What can I hope to produce? A feeling? A story?
* I'd like to get better at storytelling... No I wouldn't I just acknowledge it's powerful/useful. 

### Things I just like to do sometimes (favorite things list):
* baking/cooking
* hot tea
* fires
* finding cool music online
* listening to loud music in the car
* watching anime


really I'm not sure whether I want too much out of life. I think I came up with these just to have them like everyone else. I'm pretty content with just being commutualistic. Existing. Doing stuff when the inspiration strikes. (I overanalyze myself too much.) 

Oh yeah, the idea was not to wait for Jan 01 for new years resolutions but rather to have the results for myself by then. Working out would be good of course. Getting a job is good too. I think there's a lot more to life than work. Or is work just the life you commit to? Nah. I'm sort of torn between chasing some huge ambition or just enjoying daily life. Maybe I'm just flattering myself. 

Here's why I should stop overanalyzing myself... If I describe myself as X then am I reinforcing that behavior. Isn't it good to come to terms with your current behavior though? Does all my behavior hav eto change all the time? I'mm exhausted. 

### A reading topic list
* space pirates
* how people make decisions
* how to paramterize objects/computer graphics


I got into statistics to try and improve decision making. To make informed decisions and base stuff on "facts." To be able to decern evidence based truth from hyped fiction. I feel like I've made almost zero progress towards those goals. So I could "figure out" what the best solution to political problems were. Naive huh?  

What would that look like? Problems are... not many important situations have a long history of data. Not many important questions are easily quantifiable. 

How does one actually read a research paper and understand the claim? WHy is it so hard. I can't even answer simple questions like how does exercise affect mental health, quantifiably. 

How is mental health quantified? Measured? How are psychologists trained to identify/measure someone's mental health any better than anyone else? Screening. Stress levels in saliva? 

Maybe the better question is exercize's affect on the brain? Do I really care what happens to the brain? What about improving quality of life? What does that even mean? 
Well being able to move around when I'm older. Lengevity sure. BYU College of Sciences has a convincing page on the matter: helps remember your memories. Reduces stress receptors. Delivery of nutrients. 

The thing is, I don't think I'll ever be able to rigorously show whether exercise helps me or not. I can sorta believe. Or actually try and understand. Well 30 mins a day it is. 
How do emotions even happen? What are moods? 

Hopefully I'll get better at learning about how to make good decisions...
