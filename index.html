        <h2>Why are you doing that, Silas?</h2>
        <p>
            I've been thinking about so called "hustle culture" lately and whether it's worth pariticpating in. 
            Working exceptionally hard... applying yourself... learning... It's a script for my life that I could follow. 
            "Workaholic".... I've built a social life for myself--why would I throw that away? They talk about how long-term 
            relationships are best for your happiness. Should you work like this even if it doesn't make you happy? 
            That guy kept saying he prioritizes his goals over his relationships. He's always going to have himself 
            and reap the benefits of having invested in himself--friendships are situational. 
            I think they can be. I think we were designed to be part of a much smaller community. And emmulating that 
            still has major benefits.

            $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

            I have always had grand delusions of having influence in the world. There are so many meaningful problems to contribute 
            to. I think I excel in high-stress project based environments. Team energy and momentum. I like ambiguous problems. 
            I like when what I'm doing feels like it matters. When I'm accountable to others. 

            There are so many choices in life and a lot of good options and historically I can overthink. I've fantasized about maximizing my "inputs"
            and how hard I work on a few skills with focus. I think it might be time to start that. I got out of school and I wanted time to 
            decompress a bit. I hadn't lived anything but a student's life. I feel like I gotten a taste for partying and how to make friends in 
            2024 and 2025. It feels wonderful but I can see how it can't really be sustained. Well I bet you could--maybe just do that. 

            Single-mindedness sounds so attractive haha. I guess in reality I still want a balanced lifestyle. Maybe I just want to shift the weights 
            around a little bit. Relationships are still important to me. 

            Stopping when you're tired 

            Cemetry is full of overachievers. 


            I don't buy the idea that working on myself is somehow a scheme to squeeze profits & productivity out of me. 

            Being okay with stillness. Slowing down and experiencing the moment. Enjoy life. 

            Do things without goals? Yeah abandoning social interaction is a horrible idea. Surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals 
            only lowers complexity of thought. 



            BUT I still want to have integrity to make progress on vague long-term goals. 




            Refuse to Choose book. 



            You CAN push yourself so much further than you think. Like running--why wouldn't you? 


            People move on...

            Being around the people you want to aspire to be still shocks me. 

            Delayed gratification still is true. 

            Going to bed on time, getting in shape. These are all good things. 

            There was a lot of discussion of avoiding blunders. Maybe that's what I've been missing in chess
