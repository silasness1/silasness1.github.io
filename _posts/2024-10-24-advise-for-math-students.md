title: 10 Tips for Math Crises
---

It can be hard coming into college style math from highschool level math. The advice I give is not my own. But I'm in the process of discovering what works and what doesnt. The context for this advice was transitioning to proof based courses from application or calculation based courses.  


1) You have to believe you're capable of understanding. All maths can be made obvious through hard work being confused is the goal; it means you're learning. 

2) Get comfortable with confusion.

3) Try to get new perspectives on a problem: look at relaxed cases, visual approaches, related theorems from class, make concrete examples, find new sources to learn from, ask for help after clearly identifying what you don't understand.

4) Be there for yourself no matter what. These problems don't define your worth. Acknowledge your feelings and or frustrations.

5) Build a habit of training your intuition one problem at a time. It's a marathon and lady luck favors the people who try.

6) Making math social helps.  

7) Math is full of beautiful surprises. Asking questions even if you don't feel like it jumpstarts passion and curiosity.

8) Schedule balance in your life and create boundaries with your math relationship. 

9) Find math math enjoyment:
    1) beauty in the surprises and stories and elegance of notation during a problem--especially in how it relates to the combination of seemingly unrelated theoies. 
    2) a sense of satisfaction for finishing a problem. 
    3) seeing how theory can relate to real life-mapping real world into math abstractions and devising results. 

10) Sit down and start :)

<!-- Patterns in the development of proficiency

Remember the importance of the role of intuition. Intuition squabbling rigor and then using rigor to get back to a deeper intuitive understanding. 
Related to this idea of intuition, I think it's helpful to keep a personification of your intuition in mind (this idea is stolen from "The War of Art" by Steven Pressfield). The muse feeds you good ideas if you're meditative and listen.
“The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question 'How can we eat?' the second by the question 'Why do we eat?' and the third by the question 'Where shall we have lunch?” -Douglas Adams
I want that mastery of where shall we go for lunch. Where do you want to approximate/model the real world by math and to be able to read a paper and see if their conclusions are correct.  Specifically, problems that relate to people, policy, and social sciences or anything that contributes to our understanding of the "good life" and everyday decisions: 
How often should I wash my sheets? 
Where should I live, and should I have roommates? 
How to bake best croissants? 
How to get better at drawing? 
How do I efficiently learn a language? 
Fundamental Approaches to Self-Study

Taking an interest

Practicing skills

Problem based approach -- look up theory to solve a problem

Learn interesting areas of theory 

Basically funnels down to a top-down or bottom-up approach. Undergrad usually does bottom-up. 

Complaining about the Higher Education Experience:

I have no idea where I am in my big picture journey to building a useful skill set. There should be a hierarchical  (or maybe it's more web-like) approach to the knowledge learned. The relationships between classes and theories should be put clear and accessible. What are they teaching you? A list of course titles and chapters from individual books is a good starting point, but an organized explanation of that collection of information should be given to everyone on day 1. 

Undergraduates should have to take comprehensive final exams. -->
