## Macro Chapter 1 Recall: 

This textbook focuses on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. More classical models address 
economic aggregates in isolation or in pairwise relationsihps often through time series analysis. 
The advantage of a DSGE approach is comprehensive impact. 

At the core of the model is the simplistic consumer-reaction model? (1920s? someone's name)

All DSGE models assume rationality on the part of the agents. 

Actors fall broadly into goverment, firms, or households. Economic decisions fall into 3 categories:
consumption & goods, labor, or assets (financial and capital). 

Are these models useful for policy? Yes, but also for understanding equillibirum behavior, exogenous shocks, and _______. 

Keynesian focused a lot about disequilibrium and short-term to fix the depression. 



So at the highest level this chapter was about the context for the type of macroeconomic theory and 
how the book is structured. 

What are some of the ways model assumptions will be relaxed? 

- Closed vs open economy (whatever that means.. presence of foreign economies)? 
- Nominal vs real value of money 
- decentralized presence of markets instead of a central authority
- presence of government and fiscal policy
- price stickiness (e.g. monopolies)

What was the origin? 

Oh there's one chain of thought about representing delayed gratification (intertemporal behavior/trends)

Explaining business cycles... 


## Chapter 1 Missing:  

Catchphrase for DSGE - "considering the whole economy at all times"
Built on microeconomic foundation
stochastics may be used to cover "shocks" 
Authors viewpoint is that too much emphasis on change over time rather than relationship between parts of economy (general equilibrium); good time series fit doesn't reflcet correct causal structure; macroecnomic throy should be used for macro models

Short vs long run equilibrium: 
- the key assumption of DSGE is that the model is in long-term equilibrium not the economy. 

INdividuals' decisions' Factors: 
- budget
- endowments
- technology
- information

Ecnomic Agent Decision types: 
- goods and services
labor
asserst (pyhcial or financial) 

Ramsey 1928 model "representative-agent model" 
- Called this because the representitatve agent is the fictional guy who is controlling the economy

DSGE falls under dyynamic optmization and contro ltheory 



Traditional focused on short-run behaviro and partial-equilibrium approach  that ran difficultuiy with exogenous variables and shocks. Which also fouesd on policies to fix disequilibrium


Dynamic General Eqilibrium: 
Most traditional stil lfocuses on short-term stabilization issues like recessions inflation or employement. 

Long0term path GDP then the most imporatnt pattern is steady upward trend in potential output. Recessions are relatively small. The focus should be on growing ecnomy's capacity: long-run potential output. Supply-side policies. This is more improatnt than trying to boost or limit demand. 

origins of DSGE is in 70s and 80s using models that tryisd dto match patterns in time and between aggregates using growth theory like ramsey. 

Difference in what equilibrium means: stock equilibrium vs flow equilibrium. 

what about the criticisms? 

What about fallacy of consumption for represetntivate-agent models? 

model relaxations: 
static equilibrium vs balanced growth
fiscal policy foreign
gov
money 
asset pricing 
stochastic of forein markets, 


Tractibility of models
