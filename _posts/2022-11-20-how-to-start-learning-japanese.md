title: My Approach to Starting to Learn Japanese
---

To be fair, I'm no expert. I've had no success learning the language. On the other hand, I have semi-successfully learned German (though that was probably way easier). Mostly I wanted to document my intentions and come up with a plan. I also wanted to share the resouces I've found. I believe the first thing to do is memorize the alphabet. Doesn't seem fun. I, luckily, did this in elementary school for a class, but I totally used duolingo to brush up and thought they did a good job, but 


## Tools 

#### Duolingo
I used duolingo for learning hiragana and katakana. It's actually better for those who have no prior knowledge for learning the alphabet specifically. 

#### Language Learning Reactor
This is a browser extension for netflix and youtube that has features like autopausing, multiple subtitles and dictionary look-ups. It even can highlight words based on freqency. It's pretty much freemium, though I wish I could color code things or save specific words. Not to fear! There's a second tool to help. The idea is to carefully go through anime episodes and learn new vocabulary from there. 

#### Yomichan & Anki:
Yomichan is a another browser extention dictionary. It's better. Provides information about parts of speech. You can upload dictionaries of your choice and automate how to make anki-flashcards for words you choose to look up. Anki is an opensource flashcard software often used for memorization. The idea isn't to use

#### Japanese Immersion with Asami
This is the simplest spoken japanese I could find and it's actually kinda entertaining. Everything is slow enough and with enough context to start from zero. 

#### Organic Japanese by Cure Dolly
My main source of information is a YouTube channel called Organic Japanese by Cure Dolly. Her approach is to teach structure and encourage immersion. So most of the videos are how to understand sentence structure so that at some point you can break down new sentences as you see them. She teaches you how to recognize the underlying patterns for Japanese. It's a lot of information at once but going back through the videos when you're stuck on later examples helps. 


## The Plan
The plan is to continue watching grammar videos from Cure Dolly; in addition I'll watch the kiddo immersion videos form asami. Maybe it's better to have questions naturally come up. I can actually add cards to anki from the asami videos as well; her own subtitles are nice, but having language reactor and yomichan is way better because 1) they're in hiragana rather than romanji 2) you can save things 3) you can instantly look up more information. 

Hopefully after a few weeks of practice breaking down asami for vocab, understanding structure, & shadowing I can work my way up to learning through anime. Komi is a good show on Netflix with Japanese subtitles. Neon Evangelion is another option. We'll see. Of course I will keep up with my anki deck. Not sure yet whether I'll keep up with duolingo; it's probably good for vocab at a minimum.
